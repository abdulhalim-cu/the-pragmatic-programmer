### **Chapter 5: Bend, or Break**

**Chapter Summary**

This chapter focuses on a critical aspect of software design: creating systems that are decoupled and adaptable to change. The central theme is that rigid, tightly-coupled code is brittle and will shatter under the pressure of new requirements. A Pragmatic Programmer designs for flexibility by building components that are independent and can be reconfigured, replaced, or extended with minimal impact on the rest of the system. This chapter explores specific techniques for decoupling, managing configuration, and using metaprogramming to write code that bends gracefully rather than breaking.

Here is a breakdown of the key topics covered in Chapter 5.

#### **Topic 28: Decoupling**

Decoupling is the practice of minimizing the dependencies between modules. The less one module knows about the internal workings of another, the better. When modules are decoupled, you can change one without having to change the others. This leads to systems that are easier to maintain, test, and understand. The Law of Demeter is a key tactic for achieving this.

*   **The Law of Demeter:** A method should only call methods belonging to itself, its parameters, objects it creates, or its direct component objects. It prevents "train wreck" code (`customer.get_order().get_item().get_price()`) that creates deep dependencies.
*   **Core Idea:** Write "shy" code. Don't reveal too much about your internal structure, and don't rely on the internal structure of others.

**Python Example (Applying the Law of Demeter):**
```python
# UNPRAGMATIC (Violates Law of Demeter): A "train wreck".
class Wallet:
    def __init__(self, amount): self.amount = amount
class Customer:
    def __init__(self): self.wallet = Wallet(100)
class Paperboy:
    def collect_payment(self, customer, due_amount):
        # This code reaches THROUGH customer to get wallet. It knows too much.
        if customer.wallet.amount >= due_amount:
            customer.wallet.amount -= due_amount
            print("Payment collected.")

# PRAGMATIC (Obeys Law of Demeter):
class PragmaticWallet:
    def __init__(self, amount): self._amount = amount
    def debit(self, amount):
        if self._amount >= amount:
            self._amount -= amount
            return True
        return False

class PragmaticCustomer:
    def __init__(self): self._wallet = PragmaticWallet(100)
    # The customer provides a high-level service method.
    def make_payment(self, amount):
        # It delegates the call to its direct component (the wallet).
        return self._wallet.debit(amount)

class PragmaticPaperboy:
    def collect_payment(self, customer, due_amount):
        # This code now only talks to its "friend" - the customer.
        if customer.make_payment(due_amount):
            print("Payment collected.")
```

#### **Topic 29: Juggling the Real World**

This topic introduces the classic Model-View-Controller (MVC) pattern as a primary strategy for decoupling. The idea is to separate the application's data and business logic (the Model) from its presentation (the View). The Controller acts as an intermediary, handling user input and orchestrating updates between the Model and the View. This separation allows you to have multiple views (e.g., a web page, a mobile app screen, a CLI output) for the same underlying data, and to change the UI without touching the business logic.

*   **Core Idea:** Decouple your data model from its presentation. It's just a view.

**Python Example (Separating Model and View):**
```python
from dataclasses import dataclass
import json

# The MODEL: Contains only data and business rules.
@dataclass
class User:
    name: str
    email: str

# The VIEWS: Functions that know how to present a User model.
def render_user_as_html(user: User) -> str:
    return f'<div><h2>{user.name}</h2><p>Email: {user.email}</p></div>'

def render_user_as_json(user: User) -> str:
    return json.dumps({"name": user.name, "contact": user.email})

# The CONTROLLER: Orchestrates fetching the model and calling the view.
def user_profile_page_controller(user_id: int):
    # In a real app, this would fetch from a database.
    user_model = User(name="Dave Thomas", email="dave@pragprog.com")
    # It decides which view to use.
    return render_user_as_html(user_model)

def user_api_controller(user_id: int):
    user_model = User(name="Andy Hunt", email="andy@pragprog.com")
    return render_user_as_json(user_model)

print("--- HTML View ---\n", user_profile_page_controller(1))
print("\n--- JSON View ---\n", user_api_controller(2))
```

#### **Topic 30: Transforming Programming**

This topic discusses moving beyond a simple, linear style of programming. Instead of writing a sequence of steps, think of programming as defining a series of transformations on data. This is the core of the functional programming paradigm. This approach can lead to clearer, more predictable code because it minimizes "state" and "side effects." The book suggests that even if you're not using a purely functional language, you can apply these ideas. For example, a pipeline of functions that each take data, transform it, and pass it to the next function is often cleaner than one giant function that mutates state variables.

*   **Core Idea:** View your programs as a series of data transformations rather than a sequence of imperative commands.

**Python Example (A Data Transformation Pipeline):**
```python
# UNPRAGMATIC (Imperative, stateful):
def process_logs_imperative(logs):
    processed_logs = []
    for log_entry in logs:
        # Step 1: Filter
        if "ERROR" in log_entry:
            # Step 2: Transform
            msg = log_entry.split(":", 1)[1].strip().upper()
            # Step 3: Format
            processed_logs.append(f"ALERT: {msg}")
    return processed_logs

# PRAGMATIC (Transformation Pipeline):
def filter_errors(log_entries):
    for entry in log_entries:
        if "ERROR" in entry:
            yield entry

def extract_message(log_entries):
    for entry in log_entries:
        yield entry.split(":", 1)[1].strip()

def format_alert(messages):
    for msg in messages:
        yield f"ALERT: {msg.upper()}"

# The full transformation is a clear, composable pipeline.
raw_logs = ["INFO: System started", "ERROR: Connection failed", "DEBUG: ...", "ERROR: Timeout"]
alerts = list(format_alert(extract_message(filter_errors(raw_logs))))
print(alerts)
```

#### **Topic 31: Inheritance Tax**

Inheritance is often taught as a primary tool of object-oriented programming, but the authors warn that it can be a tax on your project's flexibility. When you inherit from a class, you create a very strong couplingâ€”you are tied not only to its public interface but often to its implementation details as well. Changes to the base class can unexpectedly break child classes. The book advocates for preferring alternatives that create looser coupling.

*   **Core Idea:** Prefer composition, interfaces (protocols), or mix-ins over implementation inheritance.
*   **Alternatives:**
    *   **Interfaces/Protocols:** Define what an object *can do* without dictating *how*.
    *   **Delegation/Composition:** Hold an instance of another object and delegate calls to it.
    *   **Mix-ins:** Add functionality to a class without being its primary parent.

**Python Example (Inheritance vs. Composition/Delegation):**
```python
# UNPRAGMATIC (Inheritance Tax): A fragile hierarchy.
class Employee:
    def __init__(self, name): self.name = name
    def sign_in(self): print(f"{self.name} signed in.")

class Manager(Employee):
    def approve_expense(self): print("Expense approved.")

# What if we need a Contractor who can sign in but isn't an Employee?
# The inheritance model is too rigid.

# PRAGMATIC (Composition and Protocols):
from typing import Protocol

class SigninPolicy(Protocol):
    def sign_in(self) -> None: ...

class StandardSignin(SigninPolicy):
    def __init__(self, name): self._name = name
    def sign_in(self) -> None: print(f"{self._name} signed in via standard system.")

class ContractorSignin(SigninPolicy):
    def __init__(self, name): self._name = name
    def sign_in(self) -> None: print(f"{self._name} signed in via contractor portal.")

class StaffMember:
    # This class is COMPOSED of a signin policy. It DELEGATES the call.
    def __init__(self, signin_policy: SigninPolicy):
        self._signin_policy = signin_policy
    def sign_in(self):
        self._signin_policy.sign_in()

# This is far more flexible.
employee = StaffMember(StandardSignin("Alice"))
contractor = StaffMember(ContractorSignin("Bob"))
employee.sign_in()
contractor.sign_in()
```

#### **Topic 32: Configuration**

Hardcoding values like database connection strings, API keys, or feature flags into your source code is a cardinal sin. It makes your application rigid and difficult to deploy in different environments (development, testing, production). Configuration should be treated as a detail that is external to the application.

*   **Core Idea:** Externalize configuration. Your application should be able to be reconfigured without changing any code.

**Python Example (Externalizing Configuration):**

Imagine a `config.yaml` file:
```yaml
# config.yaml
database:
  host: "prod-db.example.com"
  user: "prod_user"
api_key: "abc123xyz"
feature_flags:
  new_dashboard: true
```

Your application code would then read this at startup.
```python
import yaml # Requires PyYAML library

class AppConfig:
    def __init__(self, config_path):
        with open(config_path, 'r') as f:
            self._config = yaml.safe_load(f)
        print("Configuration loaded.")

    @property
    def db_host(self):
        return self._config['database']['host']
        
    @property
    def api_key(self):
        return self._config['api_key']

    def is_feature_enabled(self, feature_name):
        return self._config['feature_flags'].get(feature_name, False)

# UNPRAGMATIC (Hardcoded):
# db_host = "dev-db"
# if feature_is_on: ...

# PRAGMATIC (Configured):
# You can easily point to a different config file for testing.
# config = AppConfig('config.yaml')
# db_connection = connect(host=config.db_host, ...)
# if config.is_feature_enabled('new_dashboard'):
#     show_new_dashboard()
```
